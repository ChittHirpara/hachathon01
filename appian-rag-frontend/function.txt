A. Case Context & Awareness Features

Automatic Case Context Ingestion
The panel receives structured case data (claim type, jurisdiction, category, date) directly from the active Appian case.

Visible Context Summary
The UI clearly shows which case attributes are being used to match policies, preventing silent misinterpretation.

Read-Only Context Display
Case data is displayed but never editable, ensuring safety and preventing accidental changes.

🔹 B. Just-in-Time Knowledge Delivery Features

Persistent Knowledge Side Panel
A fixed right-side panel that remains visible throughout case handling without interrupting workflow.

Proactive Policy Surfacing
Relevant policies are displayed automatically without requiring manual search.

Context-Matched Retrieval
Policies are selected based on semantic relevance to the active case, not simple keyword matching.

Relevance-Ranked Results
Guidance items are ordered by relevance to reduce cognitive load.

🔹 C. Policy Guidance Card Features

Concise Neutral Policy Summaries
Each card provides a short, factual summary suitable for regulated environments.

Relevance Indicators (Text-Based)
Human-readable relevance labels such as “Highly Relevant” instead of misleading percentages.

Metadata Tagging
Each card displays:

Claim type

Jurisdiction / state

Document type (Policy, Regulation, SOP)

Effective date

Expandable Card Details
Cards can expand to show more context without leaving the workflow.
